# Malaria Classification using ResNet50

This repository contains code for malaria classification using ResNet50, a convolutional neural network architecture, implemented with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Cell Images for Detecting Malaria" dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria). It consists of images of cells infected and not infected with malaria.

## Instructions
1. First, mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
2. Install the required packages and download the dataset using Kaggle API.
3. Extract the downloaded zip file.
4. Preprocess the images and create the dataset.
5. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
6. Define the ResNet50 model architecture.
7. Compile and train the model.
8. Evaluate the model on the test dataset.

## Issues Encountered
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the training process was not completed. The model training took a significant amount of time, and it was terminated prematurely.

## Future Work
Future work could involve optimizing the training process, exploring techniques to reduce training time, or experimenting with different model architectures to improve performance.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by optimizing the code, completing the training process, or suggesting improvements.
